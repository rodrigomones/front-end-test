# FrontEnd Challenge

I used the **React**, **Axios** to get
the information from the Api, **MD5** to get the _hash,_ **Material UI** to
solve the UI design. Styles with **SASS** and **Styled-Components**, and the
features of **React Router Dom**, to implement dynamic routing in the web
app. The animations were made with **GSAP**.

First I made sketches of the user flow, which led me to consider an information architecture, which I then transferred to wireframes, which I used to create the basis of the web app.

I used React, taking advantage of the possibility of generating components and thus being able to split the code, which allows me to optimise its implementation and maintenance. I designed a Context, which allowed me to connect the components, sending props efficiently, keeping the code simple, tidy and easy to understand.

I also take advantage of the **LocalStorage** to store information, in this case favourites, which are maintained and can be modified.
